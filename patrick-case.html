So when someone knocked at our gate around that 5.44am, it was really early. I and my brother woke up. We went to the parlour to check on who was knocking. It's an upstairs building. So when my brother looked outside the window, through the window rather, he saw the vehicle, an RX350. And he identified the vehicle. He said, that is Bodmas' vehicle. I said, how did you know? He said, he knows. I said, okay. Then let's go back inside and sleep. Because this is an unusual hour for someone to knock at our gate."</p>

And then I observed, but I didn't really observe. So I went inside the room. Unknowingly to me, my brother had already went downstairs to open the gate. Immediately he opened the gate.

So when we got to the house, we gathered some money for about two days, and then we took my brother. They said they couldn't sustain my brother till the next morning, so they are going to refer us to FMC. We said, okay, no problem. They said we should pay for ambulance and take my brother immediately to FMC. That was at midnight on the 26th. Then they referred us to FMC that midnight. Then they drove us to FMC after paying for everything. And getting to FMC, they admitted my brother in emergency again. They referred him to the nursing home to refer us to UPCH for traction. We said, okay, no problem. Then they asked me to go get a rigid collar neck. I bought the rigid collar neck for him, ₦20,000, to make him balance. So we said UPCH. We didn't have that enough money because we were still 4 pm."</p>
